0x1D. C - Binary trees

General
Whatbinary tree
What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary trees

Tasks:

0. New node mandatory
Write a function that creates a binary tree node

Prototype: binary_tree_t *binary_tree_node(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);
Where parent is a pointer to the parent node of the node to create
And value is the value to put in the new node
When created, a node does not have any child
Your function must return a pointer to the new node, or NULL on failure
